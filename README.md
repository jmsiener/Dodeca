# Dodeca
An Open Hardware, DIY Eurorack extensible platform allowing the configuration of custom MIDI outputs. 

The Dodeca can be chained together with other Dodeca boards. The
typical configuration is the Dubldeca, which is two Dodeca boards
configured in a left and right arrangement, as used by the
[Octatrack 2x Setup Firmware](Software/Octatrack%202x%20Setup).
